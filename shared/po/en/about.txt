Well, OK, you did not learn much reading
this silly little message, but...





/iEr... the music is really awful ?

Yes, it's absolutely normal, I am just not a musician.
I will regard any proposition to replace it.












/iOh I almost forgot:

I must mention everywhere and as often as possible our
nice institution.

Anatomist was developped at the CEA,

formerly at the Service Hospitalier Frédéric Joliot until 2006,

then at NeuroSpin since 2007 (our lab has moved)


so:


Anatomist is produced by

/b/hNeuroSpin

of
/bC.E.A.

in Saclay (France)



/uNeuroSpin, CEA
well, you've written it down ?



No ?



So, again:


/b/iAnatomist, a NeuroSpin, Saclay production


etc. etc.
