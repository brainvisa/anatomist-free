\section intro Introduction

AnaFold is the Cortical Folds Recognition module for Anatomist

\section what What provides this module ?

- New objects:
  - AGraph read as folds graphs (FGraph) (AGraph)
  - AGraph read as fold model graphs (FRGraph)
  - AFGraph : fusion between model and folds graphs
- Visualization tools and modes
  - See potentials of model experts as colors on the folds graph
  - See bounding boxes of sulcus experts
- Animated simulated anneling interface

\section needed What is needed to use AnaFold ?

- SiGraph library of cortical folds recognition
- Neuron library of classical neural networks (used by SiGraph)
