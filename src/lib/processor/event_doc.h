    \brief Filering of events sent to the external wolrd (output streams)

    There are currently a number of events. The list may not be exhaustive 
    since events are dynamically created, but there's at least:

    - LoadObject
    - DeleteObject
    - FusionObjects
    - CreateWindow
    - CloseWindow
    - AddObject
    - RemoveObject
    - Exit
    - LinkedCursor

    These are not 'real' events because they are not dispatched to all 
    output streams but only to the one which asked for it:

    - GetInfo
    - ObjectInfo

}
